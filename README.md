# Digimon Partner Kit

Build your own digimon-partner digivolution line.

## Features

- Select your starter Digimon (Child- or Adult-Level)
- Select the next/prev. Level from the line
- Chose from a huge library of Digimon (over 1300 Digimons), thanks to [wikimon](https://wikimon.net) 


### Limitations

- Only main Levels are available like "Child", "Perfect" and "Ultimate". Other Levels like "Armor" are skipped to keep it simple
- Only Digivolution From/To the next/prev. Levels are possible, no Digivolutions at the same Level or skipping Levels



## Development

### Testing

All tests are collocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Coverage threshold is set to `70%`. In the `.jest` folder there is a custom provider for the all tests.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```bash
pnpm build
```

```bash
pnpm start
```
